        I want to create the most high-tech cat toy on the market. The end goal
        is to have a laser optimized to move in a mouse-like manner according to
        the cat's movements. It will take into consideration objects and only
        direct to the floor within the camera's view. A mobile/web frontend will
        allow remote access to the laser and camera. Credits to my cat who
        easily gets bored.

        x- I started off this project with the latest Raspberry Pi 5 and
        Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 as of August 2024. I got a few jumper
        cables, two servos, and a laser module. I planned the project without
        the breadboard, as there were only three simple components to be
        connected to the Pi. What I did not plan for was finding out that the
        Raspberry Pi 5 iterations removed its hardware PWM in place of a virtual
        PWM. This results in inconsistent pulses causing jitter to the servos. I
        also had trouble connecting the camera to the Pi using picamera
        installed on a virtual environment instead of system-wide. I personally
        want to keep my environments organized, and not directly installed in my
        machine. There was a workaround I found to copy the global libraries to
        the environment and then delete them tediously off the Pi.

      <p class="paragraph">
        For the hardware PWM, I had a Pi Zero 2W from some previous tinkering
        but with half a GB of RAM, VS code extensions would even be too much for
        the zero. So another Raspberry Pi 4 was purchased to build the first
        prototype. My money spent on the Pi 5 will not be wasted, as I will find
        another function for the machine. Just lots of disappointment from
        Raspberry Pi.

        I will keep this page updated once I finish the algorithm to sync cat
        detection (YOLOv8) with servo movements.
