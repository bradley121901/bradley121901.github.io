        Ever since my time at Morgan Stanley, Iâ€™ve had a growing curiousity on
        the intersection of financial markets and technology. I recently had the
        time to some reading for fun and I came across Modeling Maximum Trading
        Profits with C++ by Valerii Salov. It was an enlightening read, and to
        those that have any interest, I summarized and gave my opinion on these
        concepts in this post.

        I would first like to state the goal of trading is to make money, and
        the measure for successful trading is profit. But how would we define a
        good return and profit on investments? Say a developer built a system
        that could generate a 70 percent return on margin trading a crude oil
        futures contract for the last quarter of 2022. Though this may seem like
        a good return, we must take into consideration how much the market had
        to really offer at that time to determine the true success on that
        trading return.
